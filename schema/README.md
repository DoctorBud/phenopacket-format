This directory contains schema definitions for both JSON-Schema and
ProtoBuf. The JSON-Schema should be regarded as canonical.

The file [phenopacket-schema.json](phenopacket-schema.json) contains
the complete schema and is considered normative. Additional subsets of
the schema are provided but these are for informative purposes.

Note that currently these schemas are auto-generated from the model. See the tests in the reference implementation for more details.
